# DiabetesPrediction
This projects builds classification machine learning models in Python for diabetes prediction using LogisticRegression, SVM, RandomForest classification algorithms. Besides, GridSearchCV was applied to find the best hyperparameters for the three models. Model performances are measured via confusion matrix, precision, recall, ROC AUC.
